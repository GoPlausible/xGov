## Introduction

I’m Scott Bolasevich, known as Flipping by some, and I’ve been active in the Algorand ecosystem since 2019. As a full-stack developer on Algorand i've been trying to contribute and work with others since i arrived. I'm a fan of open source and i like to share code with others. You can see below I've documenated alot of that however unfortunately regardless of my consistent offers to help the level of gatekeeping and crynoism thats been constantly displayed to me both publically and privately at the top most levels of the algorand blockchain make it incredibly hard for me to take this application seriously or anything algorand related for that matter. I’m ready to contribute to the Algorand Governance Council just as i was the last time i offered my time and was fake invited to contribute to that council aka ATAC. Some of those same people who intentionally ignored me are still in roles at the foundation. 
If elected by some miracle, I’ll work hard to push the ecosystem forward, i have alot of orginial ideas and suggestions and in the past all of them have been blatantly and intentionally as far as im concern IGNORED. I am NOT a fan of the status qou or any of the jobs or activities the foundation has been engaging in and i view most of it as a complete and total failure. My perspective is generally from a developer and user / community engagement standpoint. Thank you for considering my candidacy.
