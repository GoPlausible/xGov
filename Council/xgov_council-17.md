## Motivation

I want to contribute to the development of the Algorand ecosystem, influence decision-making processes, and represent the interests of an active and engaged community. 

I have experience using the Algorand Wallet, participating in governance votes, and engaging with DeFi projects. Additionally, Iâ€™m familiar with other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Cosmos, and Bitcoin. 

My main focus is to promote educational efforts around Algorand, improve accessibility of information for newcomers, support decentralized tools, and encourage the growth of local grassroots initiatives.

## Acknowledgements

I confirm that I am submitting this application with my real name, agree to share my public Algorand address, and understand the responsibilities and expectations of an xGov Council member. I acknowledge that I will undergo KYC with the Algorand Foundation if selected.
